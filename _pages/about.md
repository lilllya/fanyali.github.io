I obtained my bachelor's degree from [National University of Denfense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn) and completed my graduation thesis about multi-unmanned vehicles formation control and applications. Now I'm a PhD student from [School of EEE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee/home), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg). My research area includes formation control, unmanned vehicles, intelligient systems and machine learning.

**Research interests**

An intelligient system includes three parts which are perception, planning, and control. From my past school life, I have some experiences in the three parts from image processing which belongs to "perception" to designing PID path tracking which belongs to "control". With those experiences, I find that controls on real robots give me large sense of achievements and make the tedious research work interesting and sustainable. Human-robot interaction is also included in order to make robots a powerful companion with human and endow them human intelligience.
